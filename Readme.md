This is an open source project for Fleet Coordination for Autonomous Drones.

The project is based on coordinating a large amount of AV Drones to communicate with another. The idea arose with building a Drone light show and how the drones would be able to perform with each other.

Currently, the project is in development, this page will be updated once the group analysis and research has been completed.
