This is an open source project on Fleet Coordination for Autonomous Drones.

The project is based on coordinating a large amount of AV Drones to communicate with another. The idea arose with building a drone light show and how these drones would be able to perform in sync with each other.

Currently, the project is in development. This page will be updated periodically with the group members.

To get Started we have created some links here to get our group moving.
